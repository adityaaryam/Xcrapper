# Xcrapper
An email, phone number Scrapping extension for chrome.

Provides an option to download the current webpage emails and phone-numbers as CSV.
Also an option to download the scrapped data from webpages visited in past, and also reset the record history.

I have used Regula Expressions (Regex) to extract the emails and phone numbers.
